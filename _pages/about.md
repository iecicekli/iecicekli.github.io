I just finished my undergrad studies at Galatasaray University in Mathematics.

Here you can find my CV, some lecture notes, expository articles, presentations, things I helped organize, etc .

I'm into lifting and history.

Bench: 80, Deadlift: 150 , Squat: 130 as of 2023.

I also do online tutoring for undergrad level math subjects. Contact below if interested.
